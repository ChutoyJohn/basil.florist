			<p class="titleText">Strange (written Nov 29th)</p>
                
            <p class="talkText">It's been a while, over a month now since I last wrote here. It's been really strange recently, not the bad kind of strange or the paranoid kind of strange, just strange... It feels like everything is at a standstill yet everything is moving at once, yet I'm okay with it? I don't know when it started but I've felt incredibly "okay" recently, not needing to mask how I feel, not needing to tip toe around everything, not constantly worrying about what people say and do, just "okay". I'm not sure how to feel about it, I haven't cried or felt the need too, I don't feel overwhelmed, I don't feel happy, but I don't feel sad. There is so much happening but I don't seem to have any reaction to it, I'm just "okay" with it. I want someone to talk to but I feel like no one would care or I would just annoy them, I'm contradicting myself by saying that last part but it's not a worry really, it's just the truth and I'm fine with that, I know no one cares about me really I've accepted that. So why do I feel "okay"? Everything happening recently would be driving me nuts yet it isn't. What happened? What changed that I'm now just "okay" with everything, it doesn't make sense.<br>Now that I'm thinking of it maybe it's because of the fact I have barely talked to anyone I used to, maybe it's not a feeling of "okay" but a feeling of peace, I don't know, but I'm okay now.<br>I hope.</p>

			<p class="titleText">Annoyance (written Oct 24)</p>

			<p class="thoughtText">Let me frame the picture, I have two friends I won't mention the names of, Friend A and Friend B, I consider both good friends but when they're together it's like they're completely different people, Friend B becomes really cocky and always tries to make fun of me while Friend A completely goes back on any opinions they had just so they can also make fun of me, is it right for me to be upset by this or is this just how it goes? Like for example let's take this one time, me and Friend A where discussing something I like and they also where interested in it, few hours later Friend B joins, I bring up the same thing and Friend B immediately starts taking the piss out of me and Friend A also starts to do the same, I tell Friend B to fuck off which just further eggs both of them on so I just stopped talking, is it wrong to be upset by this, I've made it clear to both of them this really upsets me but it keeps happening.</p>
            
            <p class="responseText">Why not just block them, if they keep upsetting you after you telling them you shouldn't talk to them.</p>
            
            <p class="thoughtText">I can't, you can't just block someone when everyone else you know is good friends with them, if I had that option I would've cut both of them off ages ago.</p>
            
            <p class="responseText">Just stop talking to either of them then.</p>
            
            <p class="thoughtText">That's already what I'm going to do but I need to do it in a way which won't cause a confrontation, I have no idea how to do that and I'm terrified of that happening because everytime it always makes me feel like I'm in the wrong and should just put up with all of it, I don't think I should anymore.</p>
            
            <p class="responseText">And if it does cause a confrontation what are you going to do?</p>
            
            <p class="thoughtText">Leave, simply. I'm at a point that there are only 2 people in that group I even like and I already only talk to them outside of that group, everyone else either makes fun of me, dislikes me or just uses me for free tech support or game servers, sometimes all of the above but you get the point. They'll make fun of me for leaving I'm sure but at this point I should be only caring for myself.</p>
            
            <p class="responseText">Are you sure you're even ready to do that?</p>
            
            <p class="thoughtText">Absolutely not, but it's gotta happen at some point like it always does.</p>

			<p class="titleText">Realisation (written Oct 16)</p>

			<p class="talkText">So I messed it all up, I wasn't mentally prepared at all and ended up panicking at everything going at such speed and receiving so many emails to organise meetings, I don't know why it made me panic so much and I impulsively went back on the whole thing so I'm once again back at step 1.<br>My entire life I've had this sort of support structure to help me with things like this, there was two people I saw on a regular basis which where really helpful during this whole limbo situation I've been in for 10+ years, they ended up being the only people I really trusted to not screw me over and to genuinely try to help me but they're both gone now, because of the point I've reached there isn't any reason I can see either of them again and in full honesty? I don't think I can cope, I relied on them for so long as people to talk to about what I'm worried about and what I need help with but now with no one to talk to in person, I don't know what I'm doing I'm going to be a complete failure and I don't know how to stop it.<br>But that's not the realisation that made me start writing this chapter, the realisation was the fact that what I've been calling a loop or "limbo" isn't an endless loop at all, it does have an end, an end at absolute rock bottom, a spiral if you want, every "loop" over the past years has all been building up to this, me completely failing at everything and throwing away my chance at a future, oh well, it wasn't ever going to end well anyway I came to terms with that already. 

            <p class="titleText">Worry (written Oct 1)</p>

            <p class="talkText">Around 3 weeks ago I got a tour of a college, it wasn't that bad of a place but I never got to see the entire thing because the tour guide/"Head of SEN" thought I was someone who I was not. They treated me as if I was 7 years old and had trouble communicating despite me stating this was not the case before the tour and during the tour straight to their face. I don't know what gave the tour guide this impression but it was really upsetting and completely put me off going to that college entirely but due to my "unique situation" the government will only allow me to go to that college or not at all. So now I am here, worrying about the future after trying to not think about it for 7 years... No certificates, nothing to prove I have progressed the amount I have education wise... "Oh why don't you just go take the test and get the certificate." No. I cannot, I am not allowed to apparently, the only certificates I can get which the government is willing to let me "attempt" are either much lesser certificates or fake ones which are effectively gold stars which don't actually mean anything, so I'm basically screwed, I can't get anything for my portfolio, I can't go to the college I want to because I don't have anything to prove I am capable, what can I do?<br>I have one chance which is why I am writing all this, I'm going to see someone about getting set up for my own business but knowing how everything has gone up to this point I don't have any hope for this chance or the future. But you know, there will always be something which keeps me around despite it all.<br>By the time someone reads this or even finds this hopefully I'll be better but so far? I doubt it.</p>

            <p class="titleText">Reasoning (written Sep 11)</p>

            <p class="thoughtText">I got posed with a really good question a few weeks ago, "Why do you do all this, you gain nothing from it" and I never really got to respond to it.</p>

            <p class="responseText">The truth is I don't really know why I do it, I guess to make other people smile, be happy, that kind of thing. It's really upsetting when others don't appreciate it or are just generally really mean to me but I still do it anyway for them, I don't know why.</p>

            <p class="thoughtText">Then why don't you call them out, why not mention it if it's upsetting you?</p>

            <p class="responseText">I want to but every single time in the past it has caused way more trouble then it should and started arguments, especially with certain people. So I just try to ignore it but since they're my only friends it's not something you can just entirely block out.</p>

            <p class="thoughtText">So? Just block them, if they're that big of an issue to you they're not worth being friends with.</p>

            <p class="responseText">I wish I had the mental willpower to do that, it's never that simple though, seeing as I don't have any irl friends the friends I have online are the only people I can talk to. If I cut them off it would be horrible to adjust to simply not having them as friends anymore, especially with everything else I have to worry about at the moment.</p>

            <p class="thoughtText">But they're not your only friends?</p>

            <p class="responseText">That is true but these people I'm talking about I've known the longest and make up 90% of my circle or however people phrase it. Losing them as friends would be devastating.</p>
