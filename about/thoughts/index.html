            <p class="disclaimer">Looking back this page really helped me gather my thoughts, as of Oct 31st things have gotten better in some areas, a lot worse in others but I'm doing fine. I don't really need to keep this page going and I don't really want anyone discovering my inner thoughts, especially since the way it is formatted is incredibly vivid and weird so I'm archiving it with a password and forgetting about it.<br>This was an experience, thank you to those who cared about me, knowing people cared really helped me along the way especially during my lowest points.<br>I hope one day everything will be better and I won't be in limbo but I'm still smiling and laughing so it's alright.<br><br>Thank you.</p>
