            <p class="titleText">Worry (written Oct 1)</p>

            <p class="talkText">Around 3 weeks ago I got a tour of a college, it wasn't that bad of a place but I never got to see the entire thing because the tour guide/"Head of SEN" thought I was someone who I was not. They treated me as if I was 7 years old and had trouble communicating despite me stating this was not the case before the tour and during the tour straight to their face. I don't know what gave the tour guide this impression but it was really upsetting and completely put me off going to that college entirely but due to my "unique situation" the government will only allow me to go to that college or not at all. So now I am here, worrying about the future after trying to not think about it for 7 years... No certificates, nothing to prove I have progressed the amount I have education wise... "Oh why don't you just go take the test and get the certificate." No. I cannot, I am not allowed to apparently, the only certificates I can get which the government is willing to let me "attempt" are either much lesser certificates or fake ones which are effectively gold stars which don't actually mean anything, so I'm basically screwed, I can't get anything for my portfolio, I can't go to the college I want to because I don't have anything to prove I am capable, what can I do?<br>I have one chance which is why I am writing all this, I'm going to see someone about getting a grant and starting my own business today but knowing how everything has gone up to this point I don't have any hope for this chance or the future. But you know, there will always be something which keeps me around despite it all.<br>By the time someone reads this or even finds this hopefully I'll be better but so far? I doubt it.</p>

            <p class="titleText">Reasoning (written Sep 11)</p>

            <p class="thoughtText">I got posed with a really good question a few weeks ago, "Why do you do all this, you gain nothing from it" and I never really got to respond to it.</p>

            <p class="responseText">The truth is I don't really know why I do it, I guess to make other people smile, be happy, that kind of thing. It's really upsetting when others don't appreciate it or are just generally really mean to me but I still do it anyway for them, I don't know why.</p>

            <p class="thoughtText">Then why don't you call them out, why not mention it if it's upsetting you?</p>

            <p class="responseText">I want to but every single time in the past it has caused way more trouble then it should and started arguments, especially with certain people. So I just try to ignore it but since they're my only friends it's not something you can just entirely block out.</p>

            <p class="thoughtText">So? Just block them, if they're that big of an issue to you they're not worth being friends with.</p>

            <p class="responseText">I wish I had the mental willpower to do that, it's never that simple though, seeing as I don't have any irl friends the friends I have online are the only people I can talk to. If I cut them off it would be horrible to adjust to simply not having them as friends anymore, especially with everything else I have to worry about at the moment.</p>

            <p class="thoughtText">But they're not your only friends?</p>

            <p class="responseText">That is true but these people I'm talking about I've known the longest and make up 90% of my circle or however people phrase it. Losing them as friends would be devastating.</p>
