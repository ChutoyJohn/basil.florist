            <p class="thoughtText">I got posed with a really good question a few weeks ago, "Why do you do all this, you gain nothing from it" and I never really got to respond to it.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="responseText">The truth is I don't really know why I do it, I guess to make other people smile, be happy, that kind of thing. It's really upsetting when others don't appreciate it or are just generally really mean to me but I still do it anyway for them, I don't know why.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="thoughtText">Then why don't you call them out, why not mention it if it's upsetting you?</p>
            <br>
            <p class="responseText">I want to but every single time in the past it has caused way more trouble then it should and started arguments, especially with certain people. So I just try to ignore it but since they're my only friends it's not something you can just entirely block out.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="thoughtText">So? Just block them, if they're that big of an issue to you they're not worth being friends with.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="responseText">I wish I had the mental willpower to do that, it's never that simple though, seeing as I don't have any irl friends the friends I have online are the only people I can talk to. If I cut them off it would be horrible to adjust to simply not having them as friends anymore, especially with everything else I have to worry about at the moment.</p>
