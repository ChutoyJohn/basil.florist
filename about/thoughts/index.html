            <p class="disclaimer">Keep this page to yourself please, I don't want to hear about it if you're someone I know.<br>This page exists so I can write down my thoughts instead of bottling it all up.</p>
            
            <p class="titleText">This is fine (written May 12th)</p>
            
            <p class="talkText">Yeah honestly I'm doing fine now, I'm a lot more relaxed and I haven't lost any sleep because of it, only issue is that I'm incredibly bored and I can't avoid the person who threatened me and caused me go off the deep end, they're in every group that I'm in and I know no one will take my side because that's how it always goes.<br>Do I just cut my losses and leave those groups too, keep all interactions strictly to DMs and areas that person can't reach me? I don't know. It really pisses me off though.</p>
            
            <p class="titleText">Oh god. (written May 4th)</p>
            
            <p class="talkText">Was this really the right decision, was I just delusional seeing patterns where there aren't any causing me to panic, I don't know I just don't know, I just have to roll with fate, I've literally cut myself off from everything this was such a stupid idea oh my god. Can I even go back if I wanted to? I don't think so it's too late for that now I performed such a dramatic disappearing act, do I just never reappear would that be better for everyone? All I do is hurt the people around me maybe this is for the best, I'm sorry. Please don't worry about me anymore if there is anyone who still cares.</p>
            
            <p class="titleText">Hatred (written May 2nd)</p>
            
            <p class="talkText">Got fed up with how others treat me, I only know like 2 people who actually respect my existence and don't just take advantage of my kindness and will to help others, don't make fun of me and bully me relentlessly, but the moment I lash out and start treating them how I'm being treated and start complaining about everything I get personally threatened to be kicked out if I don't start acting docile again. That's not fair, that's not fair at all.<br>So I'm going to throw it all away, can't get any worse from here I'm already at rock bottom again. Call it self destructive call it immature but over the past few months hanging out in a different group and making new friends I've realised that I can be way happier just being around other people and people who aren't vile human beings.<br>Do I deserve to be around people who take advantage of me and only keep me around for free servers and tech support? I don't know but I'm putting a stop to it either way.<br>P.S. don't see this as me walking away from everyone, you know how to find me if you want to reach out.</p>
            
            <p class="titleText">Eh. (written Apr 11/12th)</p>
            
            <p class="talkText">There's no reason I should be writing tonight I just felt like it, had an okay day I guess, watched a friend play a game I liked but I kept having this sort of feeling of disconnection? Like I wasn't really there or something I don't really know, it was an awful feeling aswell since it was the first time I've been in voice chat with anyone in that group since I got an answer about what happened recently.<br>I always did feel unwelcome in that group anyway until I became friends someone I trusted and considered a close friend.<br>I kept getting told there wasn't permanent damage in relation to what happened but there is, permanent damage to me, I open up for the first time about what was upsetting me and what I was feeling and I end up unintentionally hurting someone I care about, I don't want to do that ever again I wish I never opened up and got close to someone literally all that happens is it falls apart in the most painful way possible.<br>I want to apologise over and over but I've apologised so much that it's lost it's meaning, there is nothing I can do to repair what happened and if there is I wish someone would tell me.<br>I'm sorry, I've said it so many times but I really do mean it, I'm so sorry for everything.</p>
            
            <p class="titleText">Huh? (written Apr 9th)</p>
            
            <p class="talkText">That went weirdly well? It was kind of unnerving how well it went, despite crying my eyes out this morning about other stuff today was genuinely good, I had a good time hanging out with that friend and watching a movie together, took a few pictures and such it was fun!<br>But I don't feel I've taken a big step or anything, like I haven't actually accomplished anything by doing this. Fate even tried to screw me over by cancelling the train I had to take but luckily I'm incredibly lucky and managed to make it on time anyway via alternative methods.<br>Today was a good day despite everything recently, I don't have any hope for the future to be this nice to me ever again but that's okay, I'll smile despite it all.</p>
            
            <p class="titleText">Going all in (written Apr 8th)</p>
            
            <p class="talkText">Tomorrow I'm doing something I've never experienced before and never had the opportunity to do, something which normal people do a lot.<br>Hang out with a friend in real life, terrifying I know. Going way outside my comfort zone and going all in on being "Normal".<br>I guess after what happened I'm just being reckless with my own comfort and wellbeing but maybe if I can do a normal thing and be a normal person I might be able to get out of this pit, don't have any other options other than to put it all on the line and climb.</p>

            <p class="talkText">Well it's been a while, a lot has happened since I last wrote here but it's finally over, no more second guessing, no more delusions, no more blindfolds to keep me going. I got the truth, the definite truth, the real reason for everything.<br>And I just feel hollow.<br>I'm never letting that happen again.</p>

            <p class="talkText">The cycle is real oh my god, the pattern I kept seeing 8 years ago it's real, I had stopped thinking about it because I had changed I wasn't that paranoid person anymore but I was right, it all makes sense I know exactly what's going to happen I know exactly how things will go down it's all happened to me before this exact situation, the lines I kept drawing all make sense even now if I extend those lines to now, it's just a cycle of the same events, the same situation, the same actions, I wasn't out of my mind back then I had just realised the pattern.<br>If I next discover what I'm predicting I will discover nothing is real, not a single person I knew was real, all just part of this cruel cycle I thought wasn't real.<br>Good night.</p>
            
            <p class="titleText">Rock Bottom (written Mar 11th)</p>
            
            <p class="talkText">I think I'm finally at peace with myself, I wasn't ever going to reach the top of the spiral staircase I've been stuck at the bottom of for years, I'm fine with that.<br>Atleast I tried to climb out and saw what could be upon reaching the top, I don't see a point anymore though, 4-5 months of getting better and more stable just to fall back down to rock bottom. It just wasn't meant to be I suppose.<br>I do appreciate everyone despite everything, I just don't think anyone truly understood what was wrong but that's okay, atleast I won't be burdening anyone with my issues.</p>

            <p class="talkText">You know it's funny, I wrote "Trust" over a month ago and already I think I finally have someone I can trust, someone who seems to genuinely care about me despite everything, funnily enough someone I mentioned in "Trust", I still worry constantly about annoying them and I really shouldn't trouble them with what I'm panicking over but they seem to genuinely not mind and actually care about how I'm feeling.<br>I still get paranoid that it's all going too well and behind the scenes they secretly resent talking to me and don't want to put up with me but I think it's all just in my head, they're such a kind person and they've reassured me multiple times that it's okay and nothing is going to go wrong I can't help but burst into tears everytime. Every kind thing they've said to me has meant so much to me despite it being "common human decency" or "minimal" but it really means so much, I just don't have the words to explain how much it means to me.<br>I wish I could repay them or truly explain how much it all means to me but I don't know how or if I can even do that.<br>Due to all this I think I'm starting to feel like myself again after years of putting on an act just to fit in so thank you, thank you so much for everything, it's really nice to feel included and cared about instead of being the +1 or treated like a robot.<br>Thank you.</p>

            <p class="talkText">I don't think I've felt this emotional in years, I'm not going to get into specifics but I finally don't feel a constant state of dread and fear, I've been crying for the past hour but I'm not sad, I'm just genuinely happy.<br>Thank you, thank you so much, you don't understand how much all of that means to me.</p>
            
            <p class="titleText">Trust (written Jan 19th)</p>
            
            <p class="talkText">I really need someone to talk to about everything recently and on this page but everytime I try to either I get too scared or when I do get the false confidence to say anything they don't want to call or listen, I know what you're gonna say "why don't you just talk to someone in person" but the answer is pretty obvious, I don't have anyone to talk to in person, no friends, no one I trust, no one who cares.<br>There isn't really anyone I trust online either, there is two people I can think of but one I don't think will get it and the other I don't want to trouble with my worries, so I guess I'm sticking to writing down my thoughts on this page.<br>Hi by the way, I've never actually addressed you on this before but I appreciate you reading this whoever you are. This is probably the only way I can actually open up to someone about my worries and thoughts yet this isn't even a fraction of that but I hope it gives you a better understanding atleast.<br>I don't even know if someone is reading this but I'm putting this note here anyway just in case.<br>Thank you.</p>

			<p class="talkText">Am I just cursed or something, everytime I start to be more open with one of my long time interests it almost immediately gets bastardised by everyone and overall ruined for me, I just want one thing to myself which doesn't get smeared or made fun of by others.<br>That's why I've been so hostile and protective over certain things but I can't do anything about those things becoming mainstream on TikTok or whatever causing everyone I know to suddenly be really annoying about it because it's the "new trend".<br>Guess I just can't enjoy anything anymore.</p>

            <p class="titleText">Breakdown (written Jan 17th)</p>

            <p class="talkText">Started today already extremely worried and ended up spiraling into a complete mental breakdown, ended up having this breakdown for 4 hours until I managed to fall asleep after bashing my skull into a wall multiple times and ended up somehow having the same mental breakdown in a dream. Kind of funny that can happen in dreams aswell.<br>When I woke up I had a headache for obvious reasons and was still worrying, I messaged 4 different people if they wanted to talk or play something so I could take my mind off things but got ignored, ended up getting invited to play fortnite funnily enough an hour after that by someone else so that helped a bit.<br>This year is going to be tough, I really don't think I'll make it but I'll try.</p>

            <p class="talkText">I just hope 2025 is better... I really need a good year for once.<br>Happy new year.</p>

            <p class="titleText">Update (written Dec 9th)</p>

            <p class="talkText">Nothing good lasts forever or however it goes, back to the usual but this time, I have confirmation that my friends have actually hated me for a long time. One thing leads to another, saying the right things to the right people and you learn tons about what people actually think of you. Thanks for that by the way person who left their microphone on to echo another call and person who actually decided to tell me.<br>Appreciate it.<br>Just what to do now.</p>

			<p class="titleText">Strange (written Nov 29th)</p>
                
            <p class="talkText">It's been a while, over a month now since I last wrote here. It's been really strange recently, not the bad kind of strange or the paranoid kind of strange, just strange... It feels like everything is at a standstill yet everything is moving at once, yet I'm okay with it? I don't know when it started but I've felt incredibly "okay" recently, not needing to mask how I feel, not needing to tip toe around everything, not constantly worrying about what people say and do, just "okay". I'm not sure how to feel about it, I haven't cried or felt the need too, I haven't had any "extreme" thoughts, I don't feel overwhelmed, I don't feel happy, but I don't feel sad. There is so much happening but I don't seem to have any reaction to it, I'm just "okay" with it. I want someone to talk to but I feel like there's no one I can trust or anyone who would care plus I would probably just annoy them, I'm contradicting myself by saying that last part but it's not a worry really, it's just the truth and I'm fine with that, I know no one cares about me really I've accepted that. So why do I feel "okay"? Everything happening recently would be driving me nuts yet it isn't. What happened? What changed that I'm now just "okay" with everything, it doesn't make sense.<br>Now that I'm thinking of it maybe it's because of the fact I have barely talked to anyone I used to, maybe it's not a feeling of "okay" but a feeling of peace, I don't know, but I'm okay now.<br>I hope this isn't a fluke and I'm actually getting better.</p>

			<p class="titleText">Annoyance (written Oct 24)</p>

			<p class="thoughtText">Let me frame the picture, I have two friends I won't mention the names of, Friend A and Friend B, I consider both good friends but when they're together it's like they're completely different people, Friend B becomes really cocky and always tries to make fun of me while Friend A completely goes back on any opinions they had just so they can also make fun of me, is it right for me to be upset by this or is this just how it goes? Like for example let's take this one time, me and Friend A where discussing something I like and they also where interested in it, few hours later Friend B joins, I bring up the same thing and Friend B immediately starts taking the piss out of me and Friend A also starts to do the same, I tell Friend B to fuck off which just further eggs both of them on so I just stopped talking, is it wrong to be upset by this, I've made it clear to both of them this really upsets me but it keeps happening.</p>
            
            <p class="responseText">Why not just block them, if they keep upsetting you after you telling them you shouldn't talk to them.</p>
            
            <p class="thoughtText">I can't, you can't just block someone when everyone else you know is good friends with them, if I had that option I would've cut both of them off ages ago.</p>
            
            <p class="responseText">Just stop talking to either of them then.</p>
            
            <p class="thoughtText">That's already what I'm going to do but I need to do it in a way which won't cause a confrontation, I have no idea how to do that and I'm terrified of that happening because everytime it always makes me feel like I'm in the wrong and should just put up with all of it, I don't think I should anymore.</p>
            
            <p class="responseText">And if it does cause a confrontation what are you going to do?</p>
            
            <p class="thoughtText">Leave, simply. I'm at a point that there are only 2 people in that group I even like and I already only talk to them outside of that group, everyone else either makes fun of me, dislikes me or just uses me for free tech support or game servers, sometimes all of the above but you get the point. They'll make fun of me for leaving I'm sure but at this point I should be only caring for myself.</p>
            
            <p class="responseText">Are you sure you're even ready to do that?</p>
            
            <p class="thoughtText">Absolutely not, but it's gotta happen at some point like it always does.</p>

			<p class="titleText">Realisation (written Oct 16)</p>

			<p class="talkText">So I messed it all up, I wasn't mentally prepared at all and ended up panicking at everything going at such speed and receiving so many emails to organise meetings, I don't know why it made me panic so much and I impulsively went back on the whole thing so I'm once again back at step 1.<br>My entire life I've had this sort of support structure to help me with things like this, there was two people I saw on a regular basis which where really helpful during this whole limbo situation I've been in for 10+ years, they ended up being the only people I really trusted to not screw me over and to genuinely try to help me but they're both gone now, because of the point I've reached there isn't any reason I can see either of them again and in full honesty? I don't think I can cope, I relied on them for so long as people to talk to about what I'm worried about and what I need help with but now with no one to talk to in person, I don't know what I'm doing I'm going to be a complete failure and I don't know how to stop it.<br>But that's not the realisation that made me start writing this chapter, the realisation was the fact that what I've been calling a loop or "limbo" isn't an endless loop at all, it does have an end, an end at absolute rock bottom, a spiral if you want, every "loop" over the past years has all been building up to this, me completely failing at everything and throwing away my chance at a future, oh well, it wasn't ever going to end well anyway I came to terms with that already. 

            <p class="titleText">Worry (written Oct 1)</p>

            <p class="talkText">Around 3 weeks ago I got a tour of a college, it wasn't that bad of a place but I never got to see the entire thing because the tour guide/"Head of SEN" thought I was someone who I was not. They treated me as if I was 7 years old and had trouble communicating despite me stating this was not the case before the tour and during the tour straight to their face. I don't know what gave the tour guide this impression but it was really upsetting and completely put me off going to that college entirely but due to my "unique situation" the government will only allow me to go to that college or not at all. So now I am here, worrying about the future after trying to not think about it for 7 years... No certificates, nothing to prove I have progressed the amount I have education wise... "Oh why don't you just go take the test and get the certificate." No. I cannot, I am not allowed to apparently, the only certificates I can get which the government is willing to let me "attempt" are either much lesser certificates or fake ones which are effectively gold stars which don't actually mean anything, so I'm basically screwed, I can't get anything for my portfolio, I can't go to the college I want to because I don't have anything to prove I am capable, what can I do?<br>I have one chance which is why I am writing all this, I'm going to see someone about getting set up for my own business but knowing how everything has gone up to this point I don't have any hope for this chance or the future. But you know, there will always be something which keeps me around despite it all.<br>By the time someone reads this or even finds this hopefully I'll be better but so far? I doubt it.</p>

            <p class="titleText">Reasoning (written Sep 11)</p>

            <p class="thoughtText">I got posed with a really good question a few weeks ago, "Why do you do all this, you gain nothing from it" and I never really got to respond to it.</p>

            <p class="responseText">The truth is I don't really know why I do it, I guess to make other people smile, be happy, that kind of thing. It's really upsetting when others don't appreciate it or are just generally really mean to me but I still do it anyway for them, I don't know why.</p>

            <p class="thoughtText">Then why don't you call them out, why not mention it if it's upsetting you?</p>

            <p class="responseText">I want to but every single time in the past it has caused way more trouble then it should and started arguments, especially with certain people. So I just try to ignore it but since they're my only friends it's not something you can just entirely block out.</p>

            <p class="thoughtText">So? Just block them, if they're that big of an issue to you they're not worth being friends with.</p>

            <p class="responseText">I wish I had the mental willpower to do that, it's never that simple though, seeing as I don't have any irl friends the friends I have online are the only people I can talk to. If I cut them off it would be horrible to adjust to simply not having them as friends anymore, especially with everything else I have to worry about at the moment.</p>

            <p class="thoughtText">But they're not your only friends?</p>

            <p class="responseText">That is true but these people I'm talking about I've known the longest and make up 90% of my circle or however people phrase it. Losing them as friends would be devastating.</p>
